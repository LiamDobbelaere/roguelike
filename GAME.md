# Ideas Backlog

Pick one from this list when you don't know what to work on, write cool ideas for the game here when they come to you. In no particular order:

- Story through log items
- More extended inventory system
- Status effects
- Bosses
- Procedural weapons (procedural sprites, stats and names for the weapons)
- Procedural enemies
- Co-op play on same screen
- Co-op play online
- Multiple stories per faction
- New Game+

# Saved stuff from script.js
## Todo
- Need more level generation parameters, you need to be able to add items like 
logs (with messages in them), weapons (with stats), enemy types, enemy population etc..
Also put the player location somewhere
- Given a generated level, create a Game class that enables you to control the player and move him around,
that allows logs to be played, weapons to be collected, enemies to be attacked, all in a turn based manner
Enemies should also move after every turn.
After every turn, there's a list of things that need to appear on the screen, mostly attack messages, pickup messages and log messages
The level needs to be rerendered as objects are shifted around in the level

## Michael's game idea
**Terran Empire**  
earth with very hi tech plasma weaponry, mechs and hover aircrafts and tanks kinda like JDA from Dark Reign 2

**the reich**
super industrial fascists from a colony that made a empire with WW2 theme military and mechanical mechs

**Bandidos**
outlaw bandit kingdom that rose from neglected anarchist worlds that uses shitty weaponry but excellent guerilla and weapon tactics    kinda like Orks

**the vermin**
humanoid super intelligent rat species that developed interstellar space travel super fast in their evolution and uses a lot of mechs and power armors         kinda like Tau

**space undead**
revived ultra ancient skeletons and zombies from a extinct human warrior race, looks like heavily armored vikings.
uses huge flesh/bone golems with ancient magic powers for siege and artillery

**the bots**
a hive mind robot race that was engineered by a unknown faction. they use huge turtle spider like hive robots to produce and control the lesser bots. travels from planet to planet to kill all opposition and consume all resources to produce more bots.
